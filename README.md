Project Synopsis:

As per the todayâ€™s world the advancement in sophisticated scientific techniques is pushing human to outreach different technology in the different fields. One such field is the field of character recognition commonly known as OCR, that is, Optical Character Recognition. In this world there is a fast pace of technology and everything here is a digital information.so advancement of technology is very important and extraction of image is basic of that but anyhow Many people still choose to take notes traditionally with pen and paper. But there are some drawbacks with handwritten text. It is difficult to store and access physical documents efficiently. Severe loss of data can occur because of traditional methods of storing data.

OCR techniques and their continuous improvisation from time to time is trying to fill this gap. This project is about devising an algorithm for recognition of handwritten characters also known as HCR, that is, Handwritten Character Recognition leaving aside types of OCR that deals with recognition of computer or typewriter printed characters. A novel technique is proposed for recognition English characters using Artificial Neural Network including the schemes of feature extraction of the characters and implemented. The persistency in recognition of characters by the AN network was found to be quite 90% of times.

My project uses convolutional neural networks and other deep learning concepts that can recognize the handwritten text. My system segments the text and then assigns each segment to a character that closely resembles it. The resultant text output is then given to the user in a digitized and editable manner.
